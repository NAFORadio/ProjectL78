**Survival AI Assistant - Installation & Usage Guide**

### **What is This?**
The **Survival AI Assistant** is a **fully offline AI-powered survival knowledge system** that runs on **MacOS and Raspberry Pi OS**. It lets you:
- **Chat with an AI about survival topics**
- **Search through survival PDFs and books offline**
- **Use voice commands for hands-free operation**

This guide will walk you through setting it up from scratch, even if you‚Äôve never done anything like this before.

## **üöÄ Step 1: Install the Survival AI System**
### **Download and Run the Installer**
1. Open a **terminal** (Command Line). You can find this by searching for **Terminal** on your Mac or Pi.
2. Run this command to **download the installer**:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourrepo/survival_ai/main/Oma.sh
   ```
3. Run this command to **make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Oma.sh
   ```
4. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   ./Oma.sh
   ```

### **What This Does:**
‚úÖ Detects if you are on **MacOS or Raspberry Pi OS**
‚úÖ Installs **all necessary software**
‚úÖ Sets up an **AI model (TinyLlama 1B)**
‚úÖ Creates a **virtual environment** to keep everything organized
‚úÖ Adds a **command-line tool (`survival_ai`)** to make it easy to use

When the installation is **done**, move to Step 2.

## **üéØ Step 2: Using the Survival AI Assistant**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the AI Chatbot**
To talk to the AI about survival topics, run:
```bash
survival_ai --chat
```
This will start an **offline AI chatbot** that can answer your survival questions.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Train the AI with New PDFs**
You can add new survival books and guides to the AI‚Äôs knowledge.
#### **How to Add Survival PDFs:**
1. **Move your PDFs** to this folder:
   ```
   ~/survival_ai_data/
   ```
   If this folder does not exist, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/survival_ai_data/
   ```
2. **Run the training command:**
   ```bash
   survival_ai --train
   ```

### **What Happens?**
‚úÖ Finds all PDFs and converts them into text
‚úÖ Stores the knowledge for fast searches
‚úÖ Makes the AI smarter with your survival books

When it‚Äôs done, you can search for information from the new PDFs anytime!

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Voice Commands (Optional)**
If you want to **talk to the AI using your voice**, follow these steps:
1. **Record your voice** and save it as `voice_command.mp3`
2. **Run the voice command processor:**
   ```bash
   survival_ai --voice
   ```
3. The AI will **transcribe your command** and respond accordingly!

---

## **üîß Troubleshooting (Fixing Problems)**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AI Chatbot Won‚Äôt Start**
**Fix:** Ensure the installation completed and run:
```bash
survival_ai --chat
```
If you get an error, try:
```bash
source ~/survival_ai_env/bin/activate
```
Then rerun the chat command.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ PDFs Not Being Processed**
**Fix:**
1. Check that your PDFs are inside `~/survival_ai_data/`
2. Run the training command again:
   ```bash
   survival_ai --train
   ```
3. If errors occur, reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   source ~/survival_ai_env/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pdfminer.six langchain chromadb
   ```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Voice Commands Not Working**
**Fix:**
- Ensure `pyaudio` is installed:
  ```bash
  pip install pyaudio
  ```
- Ensure the **audio file is named correctly** (`voice_command.mp3`)
- Try running:
  ```bash
  survival_ai --voice
  ```

---

## **üìå Final Notes**
- **This AI runs completely offline**‚Äîyou do NOT need the internet after installation.
- **It works best on MacOS and Raspberry Pi**.
- **You can add new PDFs anytime** and train the AI with new knowledge.
- **If anything breaks, reinstall dependencies using:**
  ```bash
  source ~/survival_ai_env/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pdfminer.six langchain chromadb
  ```
